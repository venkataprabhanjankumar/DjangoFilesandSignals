'''
We need to Configure the signals in apps.py
'''

'''Signals are used to perform any action on modification of a model instance. 
The signals are utilities that help us to connect events with actions. 
We can develop a function that will run when a signal calls it. 
In other words, Signals are used to perform some action on modification/creation of a particular entry in Database. 
For example, One would want to create a profile instance, as soon as a new user instance is created in Database

There are 3 types of signal.

pre_save: This signal  works before  the  method save() in model.
post_save : This signal  works after  the  method save() in model.
pre_delete/post_delete: This signal  works before after delete a modelâ€™s instance (method delete()) this signal is thrown.
pre_init/post_init: This signal is thrown before/after instantiating a model (__init__() method).
